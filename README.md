# 👋 Hi, I'm Samruddhi
## 🧬 Bioinformatics Scientist | Data Science Enthusiast 

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate bioinformatics scientist with 2+ years of industry experience developing automated analysis pipelines for electrophysiology and multi-omics datasets. I love transforming complex biological data into actionable insights that drive scientific discovery.

### 🔬 What I Do

I specialize in building robust data pipelines and analytical tools that bridge the gap between raw biological data and meaningful scientific insights. My work spans across:

- **Electrophysiology Data Analysis**: Processing 5-dimensional NumPy arrays for cardiac, neural, and immuno-oncology applications.
- **Multi-omics Pipeline Development**: RNA-Seq, differential expression analysis, and pathway analysis.
- **Image Processing**: Automated biological cell image analysis using OpenCV and scikit-image.
- **Machine Learning**: Developing predictive models for clinical applications.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Creating user-friendly visualizations for cross-functional teams.

### 💡 Fun Facts about me 
- ❤️ I'm driven by the belief that every line of code I write and every cell I culture could potentially save someone's life, that's what gets me excited about computational biology
- 🧪 I can culture cancer cells by day and code bioinformatics pipelines by night 
- 🤖 Currently Learning to harness Gen AI for biological discovery - imagine having an AI assistant that can help interpret complex genomic patterns and suggest novel hypotheses
- 💻 I can switch seamlessly between Python, R, and C++ depending on what the biological problem demands
